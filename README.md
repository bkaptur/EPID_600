# EPID_600

These files were used in my course project for EPID 600 at UPenn relating to study of Mesothelioma using publicly available data from GEO and TCGA.

The uploaded datasets are the ones from the Broad Institute Pipeline that were used in this analysis. The complete datafiles are uploaded.

Additionally, the R code draft that was used for the analysis of that data as well as the GEO dataset (not included) are within this folder.

Meso_Load.R downloads and extracts the GEO dataset.

Meso_GEOa.R performs the cleaning and heatmap analyses of DE genes.

Meso_GEOb.R performs some additional analyses on the DE genes and outputs a list for network analysis.

Meso_Broad.R performs all the survival analyses from the FireBrowse files.
